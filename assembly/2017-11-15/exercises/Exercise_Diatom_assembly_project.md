# Exercise: Team based Assembly project

Work as a team to QC and potentially assemble the genomes you're given. Split up tasks between you, for example, one person run FastQC, another runs KAT hist, another runs KAT gcp, and another runs Kraken.

Keep a record of what you have done, and present the results of your analysis at the end of the session.


## Diatom Assembly Project.

### Aim:

Your task is, as a team, to assemble the genome of the diatom within these reads as best you can.
Use the tools you have been presented with to evaluate the quality of the reads, perform any necessary
filtering, assembly, assembly validation, and any additional exploration. 

### Data:

The reads can be found in the folder:

```
/proj/g2017025/exercises/Diatom_Assembly_Project
```

## Yeast Assembly Project.

### Aim:

Your task is, as a team, to investigate the data and find out why the Yeast is not assembled well.

### Data:

The reads can be found in the folder:

```
/proj/g2017025/exercises/Yeast_assembly
```

## Bacteria Assembly Project.

### Aim:

Your task is, as a team, to quality check the data and then assemble it as best you can.

### Data:

```
