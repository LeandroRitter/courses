# Exercise: Diatom Assembly project

## Aim:

Your task is, as a team, to assemble the genome of the diatom within these reads as best you can.
Use the tools you have been presented with to evaluate the quality of the reads, perform any necessary
filtering, assembly, assembly validation, and any additional exploration. Keep a record of what you
have done, and present the results of your analysis at the end of the session.

## Data:

The reads can be found in the folder:

```
/proj/g2017025/exercises/Diatom_Assembly_Project
```
