# Bacterial annotation using Prokka

Prokka is a really easy tool to use for bacterial annotation.

we provide you with 2 genomes, one really well assembled and the other badly assembled

prokka --help

the goal of the exercise is for you to learn how to use prokka and to annotate the 2 assemblies and then visualize them in IGV.



We could now also visualise all this information using a genome browser, such as [IGV](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/home). 
IGV requires a genome fasta file and any number of annotation files in GTF or GFF3 format (note that GFF3 formatted file tend to look a bit weird in IGV sometimes).
